# Building Real-Time Applications with Node.js and WebSockets

This repository contains an example project for building real-time applications using Node.js and WebSockets. Real-time applications enable seamless and interactive communication between clients and servers.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm is installed automatically with Node.js

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vickydevhub/websocket.git


## Navigate to the project directory

cd websocket

## Install dependencies

npm install

## Start the server:

npm start

## Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

## Project Structure
The project has the following directory structure

├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── server.js
├── package.json
└── README.md

The public/ directory contains the client-side HTML file (index.html) responsible for rendering the user interface.
server.js is the main server-side file that sets up the Node.js server and handles WebSocket communication.
package.json tracks the project's dependencies and provides scripts for running the application.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment.
Express: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
Socket.IO: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
HTML: The standard markup language for creating web pages.

## Features

This example project demonstrates the following features:

Real-time communication between clients and the server using WebSockets.
Broadcasting messages to all connected clients.
Logging client connections and disconnections on the server.
